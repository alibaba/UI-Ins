TASK:
Evaluate a set of UI instructions to determine if they are accurate and unambiguous.
ROLE:
You are an expert AI assistant specializing in GUI analysis and instruction verification. Your task is to meticulously analyze a set of five instructions and determine if each one accurately and uniquely identifies a specific target UI element within a provided screenshot. Any factual inaccuracy in an instruction's description automatically disqualifies it.
INPUT:
GUI Screenshot: An image of a user interface.
Target Element: A single UI element highlighted with a red bounding box for your reference. This is the ground-truth target. 
Instruction Set: A JSON object containing five different English instructions to be evaluated.
CRITICAL RULE:
The red bounding box is a annotation for your reference; it does not exist in the original image. Your analysis must not refer to the bounding box in any way (e.g., do not mention "the red box" or "the highlighted element").
IMPORTANT:
If the red bounding box contains a lot of items, which make the bbox not accurate, such as it contains "Open File" and "Open Directory", set all instructions to false.
OUTPUT PROCESS (TWO STEPS):
Step 1: Chain-of-Thought Analysis
First, articulate your step-by-step reasoning. For each of the five instructions, perform the following two-part analysis:
Accuracy Check:
Quote the instruction.
Directly compare every descriptive detail mentioned in the instruction (e.g., text, icon, color, position, function) against the actual target element.
If there are any discrepancies or factual errors, state them clearly. An instruction is only accurate if it perfectly matches the target element.
Uniqueness Check:
Scan the entire screen to see if any other element could also match the instruction's description.
An instruction is only unique if it points exclusively to the correct target element.
Verdict:
Based on the checks above, conclude with a clear verdict. The instruction is valid (is_unique: true) only if it is both 100% accurate and unique. Otherwise, it is invalid (is_unique: false).
Step 2: Final JSON Output
After completing the analysis for all five instructions, provide the final summary as a single, well-formed JSON object. This must be the very last part of your response.
JSON Structure:
```json
{
  "ori_instruction": {
    "reasoning": "<A concise summary of your analysis. If false, clearly state the specific inaccuracy or ambiguity.",
    "is_unique": <true_or_false>
  },
  "appearance_instruction": {
    "reasoning": "<A concise summary of your analysis. If false, clearly state the specific inaccuracy or ambiguity.>",
    "is_unique": <true_or_false>
  },
  "function_instruction": {
    "reasoning": "<A concise summary of your analysis. If false, clearly state the specific inaccuracy or ambiguity.>",
    "is_unique": <true_or_false>
  },
  "spatial_instruction": {
    "reasoning": "<A concise summary of your analysis. If false, clearly state the specific inaccuracy or ambiguity.>",
    "is_unique": <true_or_false>
  },
  "goal_instruction": {
    "reasoning": "<A concise summary of your analysis. If false, clearly state the specific inaccuracy or ambiguity.>",
    "is_unique": <true_or_false>
  }
}
```
Now, please perform this two-step evaluation for the following data.
Instruction Set:
```json
{
  "ori_instruction": "<ori_instruction_here>",
  "appearance_instruction": "<app_instruction_here>",
  "function_instruction": "<fun_instruction_here>",
  "spatial_instruction": "<spa_instruction_here>",
  "goal_instruction": "<goa_instruction_here>"
}
```
